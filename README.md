# UML_Project

Our school wishes to model with UML the process of its students' internships. the
internship process is initiated when the head of the internship unit receives a
application for a student internship. The latter can possibly consult the list of internships
offered by organizations approved by ENSA. This request is instructed by the person in charge
who transmits his agreement or his refusal to the student. If there is agreement, the manager seeks the
appropriate internship in the list of approved internships that it keeps up to date (add new internships,
modify courses, etc.). He informs the student of the content of the internship and submits to him the various
time slots proposed for the said course. The student communicates his choice, the person in charge
registered for the selected period with the internship organization concerned. In case that you can not
the student must notify the internship supervisor as soon as possible so that the latter can request
cancellation of registration. At the end of the course, the external supervisor transmits to the manager
an appreciation of the student's work and a document attesting to his attendance. The student
submit their printed internship report to the manager and another electronic version via
the application which will be verified by a jury made up of three professors. This jury assigns a
final grade for the internship which will be sent to the head of the internship unit.
